# Xamarin.Forms Controls Reference #
[原文链接](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/controls/)

Xamarin.Forms uses use the native controls of each target platform. This means applications can use [Portable Class Libraries](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/pcl/introduction_to_portable_class_libraries/) or [Shared Projects](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/shared_projects/) to house this shared code, and then make platform specific applications that will consume the shared code.

There are four main control groups used to create the user interface of a Xamarin.Forms application:

* [Pages](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/controls/pages)
* [Layouts](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/controls/layouts)
* [Views](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/controls/views)
* [Cells](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/controls/cells)
