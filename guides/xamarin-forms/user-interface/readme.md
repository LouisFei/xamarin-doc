> How to use the views provided by Xamarin.Forms.

## Layouts ##
Xamarin.Forms has several layouts for organizing on-screen content. StackLayout, Grid, AbsoluteLayout, ScrollView, and RelativeLayout can each be used to create beautiful, responsive user interfaces.

## Navigation ##
Xamarin.Forms provides a number of different page navigation experiences, depending upon the Page type being used.

##ListView ##
Xamarin.Forms provides a list view control to display scrolling rows of data. Some new features were added to ListView in Xamarin.Forms 1.3 and 1.4, including context actions, HasUnevenRows automatic sizing, separator customization, pull-to-refresh, and headers and footers.

## Maps ##
Adding maps requires an additional NuGet package download and some platform-specific configuration. Maps and pin markers can be added in just a few lines of code once the configuration is done.

## TableView ## 
The table view is similar to a list view, but rather than being designed for long lists of data it is intended for data-entry-style screens of scrolling controls or simple scrolling menus.

## WebView ##
Xamarin.Forms uses the native web browser control on each platform, and can display websites, local resources, and generated Html strings.

## Text ##
Xamarin.Forms has several views for presenting and receiving text. Text views can be formatted and customized for platforms. Specific font settings can enable compatibility with accessibility features.

## Gestures ##
The Xamarin.Forms GestureRecognizer class supports tap, pinch, and pan gestures on user interface controls.

## Animation ##
Xamarin.Forms includes its own animation infrastructure that's straightforward for creating simple animations, while also being versatile enough to create complex animations
